# Distributed application using RabbitMQ
Distributed application to edit and send and receive text using communication based on RabbitMQ API.

The application was developed in an incremental iterative way.

- 1st iteration : 
Creation of 3 programs: two of which will write text in text zones and the third will receive and display what was written.
The code for the editing programs is contained in Task 1 and Task2 while Task3 is the display program. The Send class will just encapsulate the details of sending messages to RabbitMQ.

- 2nd iteration : 
- 3rd iteration :
- 4th iteration :
